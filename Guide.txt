The SuperPy is a commandline tool that will help you keep track of your inventory.
You can:

- buy products

Head over to the superpy directory.

Use "python main.py followed by a command below " for Windows or "python3 main.py followed by a command below" for Mac users

Buying a product (add to the inventory): "buy --product --price --expiration"
Example: buy --product apple --price 2 --expiration 2023-11-10
- the product name should be 1 word if needed add a - between names with more then 1 word. 
- the price should be a number and can have a decimal.
--expiration should contain an expiration date for the product YYYY-MM-DD
The tool will add the current date and an ID number to the product.

Selling a product: "sell --product --price"
Example: "sell --product apple --price 3.0"
The same rules apply: product should be 1 word, price must be a number.
The tool will add the current selling date, bought_ID number and new ID number to the product

Advancing the time: "--advancetime"
Example: "--advancetime 2"

When the date is advanced, all the products that expired in the meantime are removed.

Example: "--setdate 2023-12-12"
Instead of using the advance time function you can set a date manually.
